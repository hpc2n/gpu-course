# Compiling and batch jobs

## Objectives

 - Learn how to load the necessary modules on Kebnekaise.
 - Learn how to compile CUDA code.
 - Learn how to place jobs to the batch queue.
 - Learn how to use the course reservations.

## Instructions

 1. If this is your first time using the Kebnekaise system, you must do some
    preparations. First, you should create a symbolic link from the PFS file
    system to you home directory:
    
    ```
    $ ln -s /pfs/nobackup/${HOME} ${HOME}/pfs
    ```
    
    The batch system do not have access to you home directory. You must therefore place
    the necessary files to the `~/pfs/` directory:
    
    ```
    $ cd ~/pfs/
    $ git clone https://git.cs.umu.se/mirkom/gpu_course.git
    ```
    
    After using the system for a while, your Kerberos ticket may expire. If that
    happens, then you can no longer write access your file. You can renew the
    ticket with the `kinit` command.

 2. Load the necessary modules (only on Kebnekaise):
 
    ```
    $ ml purge
    $ ml fosscuda/2019b buildenv
    ```
    
    The `purge` command unload existing modules. Note that the `purge` command
    will warn that two modules were not unloaded. This is normal and you should
    **NOT** force unload them. The `fosscuda` module loads the GNU compiler,
    the CUDA SDK and several other libraries. The `buildenv` module sets certain
    environment variables.

 3. Compile the `hello.cu` source file with `nvcc` compiler:
 
    ```
    $ nvcc -o hello hello.cu
    ```
    
    In some situations, it is beneficial to pass additional arguments to the
    host compiler (`g++` in this case):
    
    ```
    $ nvcc -o hello hello.cu -Xcompiler="-Wall"
    ```
    
    This passes the `-Wall` flag to `g++`. The flag causes the compiler to print
    extra warnings.

 4. During the course, you can use the course reservations (6 Nvidia V100 GPUs)
    to get faster access to the GPUs. The reservation `snic2020-9-161-day1` is
    valid during Wednesday and the reservation `snic2020-9-161-day2` is valid
    during Thursday. The reservations are valid from 08:45 to 17:30. 

    Note that jobs that are submitted using a reservation are not scheduled
    outside the reservation time window. You can, however, submit jobs without
    the reservation as long as you are a member of an active project. The
    project `SNIC2020-9-161` is valid until 2020-12-01.
  
    Run the program:
 
    ```
    $ srun --account=SNIC2020-9-161 --reservation=snic2020-9-161-day1 --ntasks=1 --gres=gpu:v100:1,gpuexcl --time=00:02:00 ./hello
    srun: job .... queued and waiting for resources
    srun: job .... has been allocated resources
    Host says, Hello world!
    GPU says, Hello world!
    ```
    
    This can take a few minutes if several people are trying to use the GPUs
    simultaneously. 
    
    The `srun` command places the program into the batch queue,
    
     - `--account=SNIC2020-9-161` sets the account number,
     - `--reservation=snic2020-9-161-day1` sets the reservation,
     - `--ntasks=1` sets the number of tasks to one,
     - `--gres=gpu:v100:1,gpuexcl` requests exclusive access to a single Nvidia
       Tesla V100 GPU (and 14 CPU cores), 
     - `--time=00:02:00` sets the maximum run time to two minutes (please do not
       create long jobs),
     
    and the last argument the is the program itself.
    
    You can also create an alias for the command:
    
    ```
    $ alias run_gpu="srun --account=SNIC2020-9-161 --reservation=snic2020-9-161-day1 --ntasks=1 --gres=gpu:v100:1,gpuexcl --time=00:02:00"
    $ run_gpu ./hello
    Host says, Hello world!
    GPU says, Hello world!
    ```

 5. Create a file called `batch.sh` with the following contents:
 
    ```
    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --account=SNIC2020-9-161
    #SBATCH --reservation=snic2020-9-161-day1
    #SBATCH --ntasks=1
    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:v100:1,gpuexcl
    #SBATCH --time=00:02:00

    ml purge
    ml fosscuda/2019b buildenv

    ./hello
    ```
    
    Submit the batch file:
    
    ```
    $ sbatch batch.sh 
    Submitted batch job ....
    ```
    
    You can investigate the job queue with the following command: 
    
    ```
    $ squeue -u $USER
    ```
    
    If you want an estimate for when the job will start running, you can
    give the `squeue` command the argument `--start`. By default, the output of
    the batch file goes to `slurm-<job id>.out`.
