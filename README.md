# Heterogeneous computing with performance modelling (fall 2020)

## Course description

Modern high core count CPUs and accelerators, such as GPUs, have been shown to
provide significant performance benefits in many different applications.
However, for a novice, or even for a moderately experienced scientist or
programmer, it is not always clear which applications could potentially benefit
from these resources and which do not. For example, a Nvidia V100 GPU can
perform artificial intelligence (AI) related computations in a fraction of the
time it takes a regular CPU to perform the same computations but ill-informed
OpenACC compiler pragma can actually make a code run slower. Why is this? When
should one invest time in parallelization and/or GPU-acceleration? How much
speedup can be expected with a given application?

This HPC2N course is part of the [PRACE](https://training.prace-ri.eu/)
Training courses.

**Purpose**: The main goal of this two-day online course is to start answering
these questions. The course also covers the basics of GPU programming and aims
to provide the necessary information for avoiding the most common pitfalls.

**Requirements**: The course does not require any existing GPU programming
knowledge but basic understanding of the C language and parallel programming are
required for the hands-ons.
